# oldest-person-in-an-unordered-map

this code reads a list of people from the user — each with a name and an age — and determines who is the oldest. 
it uses an unordered_map<int, std::string> to store each person's age as the key and their name as the value.

for the number of people the user is asked to enter, the code loops and: (i) reads the name and the age of each person, and (ii) stores the age as key and the person's name as value, while (iii) keeping track of the oldest person in the map.

displays the oldest person in the map.
